# Discord Bot (MemeBot)
<sup>Prerequisites: Python fundamentals</sup>
\
<sup>Versions: Python 3.10</sup>

## Introduction

## Requirements
Before we kick things off, there are a few items you will need if you don't already have them:

- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed.
- [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) installed.
- A Discord account.
- A Discord server with "Manager Server" permissions.

## How Does a Discord Bot Work

## Setting Up Discord Developer Portal
We will create and register our Discord Application within the Developer Portal. 
Afterward, we'll create a Bot for the application and get the required permissions.

### Step 1. Go to the Developer Portal.
Visit [https://discord.com/developers/applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications)
and sign in if you haven't already.

### Step 2. Create a New Application
To let Discord know we're going to be connecting to their backend servers, we need to register an application and set up the required permissions.

Click "New Application" on the top right.
